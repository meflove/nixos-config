## üöÄ Highlights

This configuration is built around a minimalist yet functional environment for development and daily use.

| Component          | Implementation                                                     |

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The configuration is organized as follows for easy management and scalability:

- `flake.nix`: The main entry point that defines dependencies and builds the entire configuration.
- `hosts/`: Configurations for specific machines (hosts).
  - `nixos-pc/`: My main PC.
  - `vm/`: A virtual machine for testing.
- `modules/`: Shared modules that are reused across hosts.
  - `nixos/`: System-level NixOS modules (kernel, drivers, services).
  - `home-manager/`: Modules for managing the user environment (dotfiles, programs).
- `users/`: User definitions and import of their Home Manager configurations.
- `overlays/`: Custom packages and fixes for existing ones.
- `secrets/`: Encrypted secrets, managed with [transcrypt](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt) (or a similar tool).
- `dotfiles/`: The actual configuration files (dotfiles) that are linked via Home Manager.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

> **Warning:** This configuration is tailored for my personal use. Feel free to use it as a reference, but you will need to make adjustments.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meflove/nixos-config.git
cd nixos-config
```

**2. Adapt it to your system:**

- Change the hostname in `flake.nix` and under the `hosts/` directory.
- Change the username in the `users/` directory.
- Review and adapt the hardware configuration, especially in `hosts/nixos-pc/nixos-pc-disk.nix` and `modules/nixos/nvidia.nix`.

**3. Build the configuration:**

```bash
# First build for a host named 'nixos-pc'
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-pc
```

For subsequent updates, simply run the same command.
